AMP HTML page

The <strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a></strong> or <strong>AMP Project</strong> allows you to create webpages that load consistently fast across devices and distribution platforms. 

The language is quite similar to HTML, with the 'amp' prefix. For example: 

\<amp-img src="welcome.jpg" alt="Welcome" height="400" width="800"></amp-img>

instead of 

\<img src="welcome.jpg" alt="Welcome" height="400" width="800"></img>

These minor differences between AMP HTML and basic HTML means building a high performing, mobile first webpage is incredibly fast and easy.
